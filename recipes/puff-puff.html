                    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                    <ul class="process">
                        <li>3 Cups of Flour</li>
                        <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> Tsps of yeast</li>
                        <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> Cups of Sugar</li>
                        <li>2 Cups of Water</li>
                        <li>Salt</li>
                        <li>Cooking Oil</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Steps</h4>
                    <ol class="process">
                        <li>Sift your flour into a bowl.</li>
                        <li>To the flour, add 1 1/5 teaspoons of yeast.</li>
                        <li>To this mixture, add in your sugar and some pinch of salt.</li>
                        <li>Mix to combine.</li>
                        <li>Add a cup of water to this mix and start mixing gently with your spatula. Gradually add more
                            water as needed until a thick, but slightly runny barter is formed.</li>
                        <li>Once properly mixed, cover the top of the bowl with a cling film, then wrap the entire bowl in
                            towels.</li>
                        <li>Keep in a warm and let it sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Once the time is up or you find that it has doubled in size, mix once again.</li>
                        <li>To your cooking pot/frying pan, add some oil - enough to deep fry a round egg.</li>
                        <li>Once your oil is hot enough, (you can test this by dipping a skewer into the oil. If bubbles
                            form around it after some seconds, your oil is ready. Alternatively, you could add a tiny drop
                            of the puff puff barter. If the floats to the top, your oil is ready.).</li>
                        <li>Oil your clean palms and scoop some, then create a hole using your thumb and the rest of your 
                            fingers, sliding your thumb over the hole to cut the barter into the oil.</li>
                        <li>Repeat the process, but be careful not to crowd your frying pan. Fry till golden brown</li>
                        <li>Take it off the heat, allow excess oil (if any,) to drain, then Enjoy!</li>
